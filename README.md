======================

Icarus is a scripting language used in Q3-engine games such as JK2 or JK:A - There's not much documentation from it aside from the old documentation and these scripts I made may serve as an example for others.

*I'll show detailed information whenever I get sometime to return to this thing, _for now_ just ask any questions if needed*
